# A Simple Crud Application
The application is developed with nodejs and VueJs. The vueJs application is serve with nodeJs hence making the application an SSR(server side rendering) application.

I created a crud API and then used VueJs to consume the API.

# Tools Used
NodeJs - This is used as the main server and backend framework for the application

ExpressJs - I choosed expressJs because of its rubust and sophisticated nature for building nodeJs projects

MongoDb - I choosed mongoDB because of its flexible data structuring support without the need to write sql queries.

Mongoose - This is used for communicating with the mongoDB database.

Nodemon - I chosed this package because it saves me the hassle of having to manually restart the server after making changes in my code while developing.

VueJs - I prefer using VueJs for client side developement because it make the development frocess seamless

Axios  - I used axios to communicate with the server, I prefer axios because it does a lot of heavy lifting task to ensure a seamless http communication
